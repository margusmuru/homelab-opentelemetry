OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides a standardized set of tools, APIs, and SDKs to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data. It is designed to handle the "three pillars of observability": traces, metrics, and logs, allowing developers to gain a comprehensive view of their software's performance and behavior. As a vendor-neutral project, OpenTelemetry offers the flexibility to send this data to a wide variety of analysis and monitoring tools without vendor lock-in.
